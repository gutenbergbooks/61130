</div>
<p class='c006'>In pursuance of a call, issued and endorsed by
several Grand Chapters, a convention of representatives
was held at Indianapolis, Indiana,
November 16th, 1876, and the General Grand
Chapter, Order of the Eastern Star, was organized.
A Ritual Committee was appointed, and in
1878 the General Grand Chapter adopted the work,
and it was published by its authority. At the session
in 1883, a committee on Ritual was appointed,
with instructions to receive all proper amendments,
and report the same at the next meeting.
In 1886, the Committee was continued. At the
session in 1889, the Ritual Committee, consisting
of Jerome Spaulding, Mary A. Hepler and Lorraine
J. Pitkin, presented the following Ritual as the
result of their labors, which was adopted.</p>

<p class='c004'>We hereby certify the following to be the Ritual
as revised at the session of the General Grand
Chapter, September, 1889.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c009'>TITLE.</h3>
<p class='c006'>This organization shall be known as "<span class='sc'>The
Order of the Eastern Star</span>."</p>
<h3 class='c009'>MEMBERSHIP.</h3>
<p class='c006'>Master Masons in good standing in a Masonic
Lodge, and their wives, daughters, mothers,
widows, and sisters, who have attained the age of
eighteen years, are eligible to membership in this
Order.</p>
<h3 class='c009'>GOVERNMENT.</h3>
<p class='c006'>The government of the Order is vested in three
bodies, named respectively, in the order of their
rank, General Grand Chapter, Grand Chapter,
and Subordinate Chapter.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_VIII'></a>
  <h3 class='c009'>GENERAL GRAND CHAPTER.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The authority of the General Grand Chapter is
supreme when exercised within the limits defined
and prescribed by its Constitution. It has no
jurisdiction over matters not specifically given to
its control by that instrument.</p>
<h3 class='c009'>GRAND CHAPTER.</h3>
<p class='c006'>The authority of a Grand Chapter is supreme
within its jurisdiction, excepting upon matters
which are within the control of the General
Grand Chapter. Its jurisdiction shall not include
more than one State or Territory.</p>
<h3 class='c009'>SUBORDINATE CHAPTER.</h3>
<p class='c006'>The authority of a Subordinate Chapter is prescribed
and limited by the Grand Chapter within
whose jurisdiction it exists. Five Subordinate
Chapters within any State or Territory where no
Grand Chapter exists, may organize a Grand
Chapter, possessing all the lawful powers of such
a Chapter within said State or Territory.</p>
<h3 class='c009'>LANDMARKS.</h3>
<p class='c006'>1.  A belief in the existence of a Supreme
Being.</p>

<p class='c004'>2.  In the Order of the Eastern Star there are
only five degrees, known as Adah, the daughter;
Ruth, the widow; Esther, the wife; Martha, the
sister; and Electa, the mother.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_IX'></a>3.  The name of the Order, the names of its
degrees, and modes of recognition are unchangeable.</p>

<p class='c004'>4.  Its lessons are Scriptural, its teachings
moral, and its purposes beneficent.</p>

<p class='c004'>5.  Its obligations are based upon the honor of
those who obtain its secrets, and are framed upon
the principle that whatever benefits are due by
Masons to the wives, daughters, mothers, widows
and sisters of Masons, reciprocal duties are due
from them to the Brotherhood.</p>

<p class='c004'>6.  That the obligation of our Order, voluntarily
assumed, is perpetual, from the force of which
there is no release.</p>

<p class='c004'>7.  The ballot, for candidates for the degrees, or
membership, must be unanimous, without debate,
and kept inviolably secret.</p>

<p class='c004'>8.  The degrees cannot be conferred unless a
brother in good standing shall preside. He can
call upon the Worthy Matron to assist in conferring
the degrees.</p>

<p class='c004'>9.  Every member is amenable to the laws of
the Order, and may be tried for offenses, either by
the Chapter to which the member belongs, or by
the Chapter within whose jurisdiction the member
resides.</p>

<p class='c004'>10.  The right of every member to appeal from
the decision of a Subordinate Chapter, to the
Grand Chapter or its executive head.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_X'></a>11.  The right of every Chapter to decide, from
among eligible candidates, who shall be admitted
to membership.</p>

<p class='c004'>12.  The right of every member to visit any
regular Chapter unless lawful objection is made
to such visitor.</p>
<h3 class='c009'>SUBORDINATE CHAPTERS.</h3>
<p class='c006'>Every Subordinate Chapter must have a Charter
or Dispensation legally issued, and always
present at its meetings, without which it cannot
legally act.</p>
<h3 class='c009'>OFFICERS.</h3>
<p class='c006'>The officers of a Subordinate Chapter shall be:</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The Stations of the several Officers are indicated
on the Plan of Chapter Room on page 12.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_XI'></a>The first seven shall be elected by separate and
majority ballot, and the others shall be appointed
by the Worthy Matron.</p>
<h3 class='c009'>MEETINGS.</h3>
<p class='c006'>The meetings of a Chapter are either regular or
special. Regular meetings are those held at
stated intervals as prescribed by its By-laws.
Special meetings are those held by appointment
of the Worthy Matron or other lawful authority.</p>
<h3 class='c009'>QUORUM.</h3>
<p class='c006'>Seven members, including one of the first three
officers, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business, unless the By-laws of the
Chapter shall prescribe a larger number.</p>
<h3 class='c009'>PETITIONS.</h3>
<p class='c006'>A petition for the degrees or membership
must be signed by the petitioner and two members
of the Chapter, who recommend the petitioner.
The petition must be received at a
regular meeting of the Chapter, unless the
Grand Chapter of its jurisdiction shall otherwise
provide; and when received, must be referred to
a committee of three members, one of whom shall
be a brother, appointed by the presiding officer.
The committee can only report at a regular
meeting.</p>
<div>
  <a id='Page_XII'></a>
  <h3 class='c009'>THE BALLOT.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The ballot upon petitions for the degrees or
membership, can only be taken at a regular meeting.
The Associate Conductress shall have charge
of the ballot-box, under the direction of the
Worthy Matron. After it has been examined
by the Worthy Matron and Associate Matron,
she shall present it to the Worthy Matron and
Worthy Patron for their ballot, and may carry it
to every member present&mdash;or <i>may</i> place it upon
the Altar. If placed upon the Altar, every member
entitled to a vote shall approach the Altar
from the West, between Ruth and Esther, make
the sign of salutation, deposit their ballot, leaving
between Esther and Martha.</p>

<p class='c004'>The member balloting must be at least three
paces in advance of the one who directly follows.</p>

<p class='c004'>When all have voted, the Worthy Matron shall
declare the ballot closed, and direct the Associate
Conductress to bear the ballot box West and East.</p>

<p class='c004'>After it has been examined by the Associate
Matron, the Matron will ask:</p>

<p class='c004'><i>W. M.</i> Sister Associate Matron.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>A. M.</i> Worthy Matron.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>W. M.</i> How is the ballot in the West?</p>

<p class='c012'>The Associate Matron will say:</p>

<p class='c011'><a id='Page_XIII'></a><i>A. M.</i> The ballot is clear, (or not clear,) Worthy
Matron.</p>

<p class='c012'>After the W. M. has inspected it, and no black balls
appear, she will say:</p>

<p class='c011'><i>W. M.</i> The ballot being clear in the East, I
have the pleasure to inform you that you have
elected &mdash;&mdash; to receive the degrees, (or become
a member,) in this Chapter.</p>

<p class='c012'>If the ballot is not clear, but so nearly so that the result
may have been from mistake, a second and final ballot may
be ordered. If the final ballot is dark, the W. M. will say:</p>

<p class='c011'><i>W. M.</i> The ballot not being clear, I have to
announce that the petition of &mdash;&mdash; is rejected.</p>
<h3 class='c009'>MEMBERSHIP.</h3>
<p class='c006'>Membership can only be forfeited by dimission,
suspension, or expulsion from a Chapter, excepting
that the suspension or expulsion of a brother
from a Masonic Lodge, for any other cause than
non-payment of dues, deprives him of all the
rights of membership in this Order until reinstated
by the Masonic body.</p>
<h3 class='c009'>BADGES, JEWELS, AND REGALIA.</h3>
<p class='c006'>The officers shall wear during Chapter sessions
the badge of office belonging to their respective
offices. The badge shall consist of the appropriate
Jewel, made of gold or gilded metal and suspended
<a id='Page_XIV'></a>by a ribbon having the five colors of the
Order.</p>

<p class='c004'>Collars, Robes, and other regalia in addition to
what is here prescribed may be worn by Chapters
that desire them; the General Grand Chapter only
prescribing the minimum.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'>The Initiation Ceremony is the same for
gentlemen as for ladies, and both may receive the
degrees at the same time. The necessary changes
in language must be made as circumstances require.
The time having arrived for initiation,
and it being probable that candidates are in waiting,
if robes are used, the officers retire, and prepare
for the ceremony of initiation.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>W. M.</i> Sister Associate Conductress.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>A. C.</i> Worthy Matron.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>W. M.</i> You will retire and ascertain if
there are candidates in waiting to receive
the degrees.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Associate Conductress advances to the
west of the Altar, gives the Sign of Salutation, and
(the Warder having given the usual raps and
opened the door,) retires. Ascertaining the name
of the candidate, she returns, and standing west of
the Altar, gives the Sign of Salutation and says:</p>

<p class='c011'><i>A. C.</i> Worthy Matron, I find in waiting &mdash; &mdash;
who is desirous of being
initiated into our Order.</p>

<p class='c012'><a id='Page_XLII'></a>The Worthy Matron invites the Worthy Patron
to preside for the purpose of conferring the degrees.
The Worthy Patron, taking the chair, says:</p>

<p class='c011'><i>W. P.</i> Sister Secretary.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Sec'y.</i> Worthy Patron.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>W. P.</i> Has this candidate been elected
to receive the degrees of the Order?</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Sec'y.</i> She has, Worthy Patron.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>W. P.</i> Sister Associate Conductress,
you will retire and prepare the candidate
for the ceremonies of initiation.</p>

<p class='c012'>She gives the sign, and retires as before. Taking
the candidate into the preparation room, she
says:</p>

<p class='c011'><i>A. C.</i> Do you believe in the existence
of a Supreme Being? <i>Ans.</i> I do.</p>

<p class='c004'>My friend, human life is a labyrinth
through which we all wander blindly, and
too often, in ignorance. It is good to consider
the experience of others, and profit
by their knowledge and example. Having
received the degrees of our Order, and
therefore being able to assist you, permit
me to direct your preparation for the ceremonies
of initiation.</p>

<p class='c012'>She then removes the candidate's hat, gloves
and shawl or cloak, prepares and leads her to the</p>
<p class='c012'><a id='Page_XLIII'></a>door of the Chapter-room. The Associate Conductress
gives five raps upon the door, ** ** *</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Cond.</i> Worthy Patron, there is an
alarm at the door of the preparation room.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>W. P.</i> Sister Conductress, you will ascertain
the cause of the alarm.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Conductress goes to the door, answers the
alarm, ** ** * * and opening the door, says:</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Cond.</i> Who knocks at the door of our
Chapter?</p>

<p class='c004'><i>A. C.</i> The Associate Conductress with
a candidate, who desires to be initiated
into our Order.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Cond.</i> Is she properly prepared?</p>

<p class='c004'><i>A. C.</i> She is.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Cond.</i> My friend, you will wait until
further orders are received from the
Worthy Patron.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Conductress closes the door, and, advancing
to a position in front of the Associate Matron,
facing the East, says:</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Cond.</i> Worthy Patron, the alarm was
caused by the Associate Conductress with
a candidate, who desires to receive the
degrees of our Order.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_XLIV'></a><i>W. P.</i> Is the candidate properly prepared?</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Cond.</i> She is.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>W. P.</i> You will admit her.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Conductress returning to the door, opens it
wide, and says:</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Cond.</i> It is the order of the Worthy
Patron that you be admitted to our Chapter.</p>

<p class='c012'>Before the door is opened to receive the candidate
the lights may be turned down, and soft music
played during this lecture by the Conductress.
The candidate is led inside the door and stopped.
The Conductress then says to her:</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Cond.</i> You have doubtless well considered
the step you have taken in seeking
admission to this Order, dedicated to
Charity, Truth, and Loving-kindness.
You came here of your own free choice.
Complain not, therefore, at any trial. A
seal is here set upon your lips. Let it
warn you to be ever silent and secret, as
to all that may be made known to you
here. Be not weary in well-doing. Woe
unto those who seek to take upon themselves
burdens which they cannot bear.
<a id='Page_XLV'></a>Woe unto the faithless and insincere, who
assume obligations lightly and forthwith
forget them. "Trust in the Lord with all
thine heart, and lean not unto thine own
understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge
Him, and He will direct thy paths."</p>

<p class='c012'>Conductress offers her right arm to the candidate.
If there are two the Associate Conductress
offers her left arm to the candidate and in like manner
follows with the second. The Associate Conductress
assists only when necessary to form
couples. The candidate is conducted once around
the room to the Associate Matron. Officers and
members always observe square corners.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the march, vocal or instrumental music
is furnished, or the Worthy Patron may recite
the following:</p>

<p class='c011'><i>W. P.</i> "Though I speak with the tongues of
men, and of angels, and have not charity, I am
become as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal."</p>

<p class='c004'>"Charity suffereth long, and is kind: charity
envieth not."</p>

<p class='c004'>"Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the
truth."</p>

<p class='c004'>"And now abideth Faith, Hope and Charity,
but the greatest of these is Charity."</p>

<p class='c012'>Having arrived at the West, the candidate is
introduced to the Associate Matron.</p>

<p class='c012'>Conductress and candidate face the East.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>A. M.</i> Worthy Matron, I have the
honor to present &mdash; &mdash;whose
petition has been approved by this Chapter,
and who is now ready to assume our
Obligation.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Worthy Matron rises and addresses the
candidate.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>W. M.</i> It is with pleasure that I welcome
you into this Chapter. Your relation
to the Masonic fraternity, and the recommendations
presented in your behalf,
assure us that you merit the honor we
confer, and are worthy of the important
trust with which we are about to invest
you. The Order of the Eastern Star exists
for the purpose of giving practical effect
to one of the beneficent purposes of Freemasonry,
which is to provide for the welfare
<a id='Page_XLVII'></a>of the wives, daughters, mothers,
widows, and sisters of Master Masons.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here they may share with the Masonic
brother in promulgating the principles
of Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here we may aid, comfort, and protect
each other in our journey through the
labyrinth of human life, and by cheerful
companionship and social enjoyments,
lighten the burdens of active duty.</p>

<p class='c004'>By means of secret signs, and other
work of the Order, we are able to make
ourselves known to each other wherever
we may meet.</p>

<p class='c004'>We are governed by the laws and regulations
of the Grand Chapter, and by a code
of By-Laws framed by ourselves. These
we are bound to obey so long as we remain
members of the Order, and in this
obedience, we shall expect you to share.</p>

<p class='c012'>Addressing the Worthy Patron, the Worthy
Matron says:</p>

<p class='c011'>Worthy Patron, it is with pleasure that
I introduce to you this candidate, who is
prepared to assume the Obligation of the
Order.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_XLVIII'></a><i>W. P.</i> The obligation you are about to
take is a solemn pledge which you must
give to this Chapter, before you can participate
in the privileges of our Order.
By it you bind yourself to the most
solemn secrecy respecting the work of
the Order, and to the performance of those
acts of kindness and forbearance, which
are essential to our welfare and prosperity.</p>

<p class='c004'>With this knowledge of its requirements
are you willing to proceed?</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Cand.</i> I am.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>W. P.</i> Sister Conductress, you will
cause the candidate to be in proper position
at the Altar to receive the Obligation.

<p class='c012'>During the march there should be vocal or

<p class='c011'><i>Cond.</i> Worthy Patron, the candidate
is in proper position.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Chapter is called up, and the Worthy
Patron takes his position on the east side of
the Altar, and causes the candidate to repeat
after him the following. Soft music may be
played during obligation.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>W. P.</i> Arise, my sister, we accept the
pledge you have given, and share with you
in this solemn Obligation.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Conductress takes the Bible from the
candidate, when the Worthy Patron says: "Arise,
my sister," he extends his right hand and assists
the candidate in rising, the lights are suddenly
turned up at the same time.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>W. P.</i> You will now be received into
our Order and be conducted to the several
points of the Star, where you will receive
instruction in those sublime virtues exemplified
in the lives of Adah, Ruth,
Esther, Martha, and Electa.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Worthy Patron returns to the East, and
seats the Chapter.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Conductress and candidate will leave the
Altar on the right, passing out between Electa
and Adah, leaving Adah on the right, all around
the outside of the Star to Adah for instruction.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the march there should be vocal or instrumental
music, or the Worthy Patron may
recite the following:</p>

<p class='c011'><i>W. P.</i> "Happy is the man that findeth wisdom
and the man that getteth understanding."</p>

<p class='c004'>"She is more precious than rubies, and all the
things thou canst desire are not to be compared

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_L'></a>"Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her
paths are peace."</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Cond.</i> Sister Adah.</p>

<p class='c012'>Adah rises and takes her position at the right
of her chair; after each lecture the Star Officer
will remain in her position, standing until the
Conductress and candidate have passed her, then
be seated.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Adah.</i> Sister Conductress.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Cond.</i> I present this Sister, who, having
assumed our Obligation, will receive
from you such lessons respecting fidelity
to convictions of right and duty, as may
properly be drawn from the history of
Jephthah's Daughter.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Adah.</i> Jephthah was the ninth judge
and one of the mightiest men in Israel.
Being called upon, in the extremity of his
country's trials, to go at the head of its
armies, he prepared his household for a
campaign that would perhaps cost him his
life; and then "Jephthah vowed a vow
unto the Lord, and said, 'If thou shalt deliver
the children of Ammon into mine
hands then it shall be that whatsoever
cometh forth of the doors of my house to
meet me when I return in peace shall
surely be the Lord's, and I will offer it up
for a burnt offering.'" Jephthah went
<a id='Page_LI'></a>forth to battle, the victory was gained,
and the victorious warrior returned to
Mizpeh. The door of his house opened,
and, "behold! his daughter came out to
meet him with timbrels and with dances,"
and she was his only child. Jephthah,
when he saw her, rent his clothes, and in
the anguish of his heart, cried aloud,
"Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me
very low, for I have opened my mouth unto
the Lord, and I cannot go back." Adah
replied, "My father, if thou hast opened
thy mouth unto the Lord, do to me according
to that which has proceeded out of thy
mouth." She asked that she might go
among the mountains for two months, and
there prepare her mind for the solemn surrender
of her life to preserve her father's
honor.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the two months had expired, she
was seen, followed by her friends, winding
her way down the mountain's side to the
altar, where her father with an almost
broken heart was prepared to fulfil his
vow.</p>

<p class='c004'>She approached her father with a kiss
of affection and bade him farewell. Taking
hold of the veil she wore, he threw it
over her face, and drew his sword. But
she unveiled herself, and said she need
not have her face covered for she was not
<a id='Page_LII'></a>afraid to die. Her father replied that he
could not strike the blow while she looked
upon him, and again cast it over her. She
threw it off the second time, and said she
would look upward, that his arm might
not be unnerved by her gaze. A third
time, however, he insisted, and a third
time she as resolutely cast it off, this
time holding the ends of it firmly in her
hands and casting her eyes upward, invited
the fatal blow. And a deed was
consummated which has rendered the
name of Jephthah's Daughter famous in
the annals of Scripture.</p>

light, suffering no stain to rest upon her
memory.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_LIII'></a>Sister Conductress, you will present this

<p class='c012'>The Conductress will lead the candidate around

chairs to the right and the Altar to the left. From
Ruth around Electa to Esther; from Esther around
Adah to Martha; from Martha around Ruth to
Electa; from Electa around Esther to the Worthy

meet him, with timbrels and with dances: and
she was his only child; beside her he had neither
son nor daughter."</p>

<p class='c004'>"And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he
rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou
hast brought me very low, and thou art one of
them that trouble me: for I have opened my
mouth unto the Lord, and I cannot go back."</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Cond.</i> Sister Ruth.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ruth rises and takes her position at the right
of her chair.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ruth.</i> Sister Conductress.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Cond.</i> I present this sister to be instructed
in the duty of obedience to the
demands of honor and justice in all conditions
<a id='Page_LIV'></a>of life, as illustrated in the history
of Ruth.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Ruth.</i> About eleven hundred years before
the Christian era, Elimeleck and his
wife Naomi, with their two sons, were
driven by famine from Bethlehem to the
land of Moab. The sons married women
of Moab named Ruth and Orphah. After
a few years, Elimeleck and his sons died,
leaving Naomi, Ruth and Orphah in
mourning. Naomi, aged and dependent,
resolved to return to the land of her
nativity. She urged Ruth and Orphah to
remain with their kindred and friends,
rather than follow her in poverty to a land
of strangers. But Ruth believed it to be
her duty to remain with Naomi and assist
in her maintenance, saying, "Entreat me
not to leave thee, or to return from following
after thee: for whither thou goest, I
will go, and where thou lodgest I will
lodge, thy people shall be my people, and
thy God my God."</p>

<p class='c004'>They arrived in Bethlehem, destitute,
weary and worn, and Ruth was compelled
to seek through menial labor the means of
support for herself and the aged Naomi.
Faithful to the duties which adverse fortune
had thrown upon her, she became a gleaner
in the fields of Boaz, who said to his servant
that was set over his reapers, "Whose
<a id='Page_LV'></a>damsel is this?" Upon being informed of
her history, her devotion to Naomi, and
present circumstances, advanced to where
she was resting and addressed to her
kindly words of encouragement. Ruth
raised her hands to show him how small
were her gleanings, and that she had not
taken from the sheaves; placed them
meekly upon her breast as proof of her
willingness to submit to whatever lot she
might be called upon to endure, casting her
eyes upward, as appealing to God.</p>

<p class='c004'>He ordered his reapers to drop handfuls
of barley that she might gather a supply,
and invited her to eat and drink of the
provisions he had supplied. Ruth was encouraged;
and at evening, returned laden
with the fruits of her toil to gladden the
heart of Naomi. My sister, be faithful to
the duties of your station; ever teaching
that honor and justice which Ruth portrayed
in the touching and beautiful incidents
of her life.</p>

over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?"</p>

<p class='c013'>"And the servant, that was set over the reapers,

<p class='c011'><i>Cond.</i> Sister Esther.</p>

<p class='c012'>Esther rises and takes her position at the right
of her chair.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Esther.</i> Sister Conductress.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Cond.</i> I present this sister to be instructed
in the commendable virtue of
fidelity to kindred and friends as exemplified
in the history of Esther.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_LVII'></a><i>Esther.</i> Esther was a Jewish damsel,
living about five hundred years before the
Christian era. The Jews were then held
in captivity within the Persian empire.
After the divorce of Queen Vashti, the
king caused search to be made throughout
the empire for the most beautiful woman,
to be her successor. The choice fell
upon Esther, who, amid national rejoicing
and royal magnificence, became the queen
of Persia.</p>

<p class='c004'>The knowledge of her descent from the
captive race was carefully concealed from
the king and his court. In due time the
enemies of the Jews, being powerful and
numerous, persuaded the king to issue a
royal edict commanding that upon a given
day the entire Hebrew race should be destroyed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Queen Esther, when informed of the
cruel edict, resolved to risk the loss of
royal favor and life itself, to save her people
from death.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a law of the palace that no one,
not even the queen, should enter the king's
presence unsummoned, under penalty of
death, unless the king should extend the
golden sceptre as a signal of pardon.</p>

<p class='c004'>Esther, attired in her queenly apparel,
with heroic purpose, sought the presence
of the king. It was the day of the grand
<a id='Page_LVIII'></a>council of governors, princes and officers
of Persia. The royal guards held all
avenues of approach to the council chamber.
The king sat upon his throne of gold
and ivory, surrounded by the highest
officials of his empire. The queen approached.
The guards and palace officials
were stricken with terror at the unbidden
advance of the queen. The king's countenance
flushed with anger when he beheld
her intrusion. Queen Esther, fixing her
eyes, now eloquent with her soul's heroic
purpose upon the king, firmly advanced
to the foot of the throne, at once reminding
him of his former pledges by
touching her crown and robe in which he
had desired her to appear when claiming
his promise. She secured pardon by laying
her hand upon the golden sceptre which
he extended to her. Graciously, said the
king, "What wilt thou, Queen Esther?
and what is thy request? it shall be even
given thee to the half of the kingdom."
Esther's perilous adventure was successful.</p>

<p class='c004'>The king relented from his cruel purpose,
and spared the chosen people.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Crown and Sceptre united is an emblem

<p class='c004'>Sister Conductress, you will present this
sister at the fourth point of the Star for
further instruction.</p>

<p class='c012'>The candidate is conducted around Esther's

leaving the Altar to the left, around Adah's chair

<p class='c013'>During the march there should be vocal or

<p class='c011'><i>W. P.</i> "And it was so, when the king saw
Esther the queen standing in the court, that she
obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out
to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand.
So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the
sceptre."</p>

<p class='c004'>"Then said the king unto her, 'What wilt thou,
Queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall
be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.'"</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Cond.</i> Sister Martha.</p>

<p class='c012'>Martha rises and takes her position at the <i>left</i>
of her chair.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Martha.</i> Sister Conductress.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Cond.</i> I present this sister to be instructed
in the sublime virtue of a trustful
<a id='Page_LX'></a>faith, in the hour of trial, and hope of
immortal life, as illustrated in the history
of Martha.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Martha.</i> The history of Martha is that
of a young woman oppressed with grief at
the loss of an only brother.</p>

<p class='c004'>The family, consisting of Martha, and
Mary, and their brother Lazarus, were residents
of Bethany. They were known
among the people of the country as followers
of Christ. During the absence of
Jesus, Lazarus was taken ill, and in a short
time died. At the close of the fourth day,
intelligence reached them that Jesus
was returning to Bethany. Martha hastened
to meet him, raising her hands imploringly
towards his face, looking upward
with suppressed emotion, cried aloud,
"Lord if thou hadst been here, my brother
had not died. But I know that even now,
whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will
give it thee."</p>

<p class='c004'>"Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall
rise again."</p>

<p class='c004'>"Martha saith unto him, 'I know that he
shall rise again in the resurrection at the
last day.'"</p>

<p class='c004'>"Jesus saith unto her, I am the Resurrection
and the Life, he that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live, and
<a id='Page_LXI'></a>whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall
never die. Believest thou this?"  Here is
the record of her unfaltering trust; here
the record of her hope, inspired by the
teachings of Jesus, that beyond the grave,
the loved ones gone before are waiting to
welcome us to our eternal home.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the measureless realm of time, how
brief is our earthly life; yet how momentous
and eternal its issues! Life's experiences,
coming thick and fast, are the
soul's appointed means of growth. To-day,
we build our castles, to-morrow, fickle fortune
snatches from hope the promised joy.
To-day, prosperity or the presence of
loved ones fills our cup with joy; to-morrow,
adversity, or sore bereavement casts
us into the valley of sorrow.</p>

<p class='c004'>My sister, may you have the trustful faith
of Martha; it will lighten the burden of
sorrow, and incline you to the voice of
duty.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sign of this degree is given by&mdash;</p>

<p class='c012'>Repeat from secret work. (12.)</p>

<p class='c011'>The pass. (13.)</p>

<p class='c004'>The color appropriate to this degree is
green; an emblem of nature's life and
beauty, and a symbol of Martha's trustful
faith and hope of immortality.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_LXII'></a>The Broken Column is an expressive
emblem of the uncertainty of human life.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sister Conductress, you will present this
sister at the fifth point of the Star for
further instruction.</p>

<p class='c012'>The candidate is conducted around Martha's
chair, leaving the chair to the right, then across
the Star leaving the Altar to the left, around
Ruth's chair to Electa for instruction.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the march there should be vocal or
instrumental music, or the Worthy Patron may
recite the following:</p>

<p class='c013'><i>W. P.</i> "Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if
thou hadst been here my brother had not died."</p>

<p class='c013'>"But I know that even now, whatsoever thou
wilt ask of God, God will give it thee."</p>

<p class='c013'>"Jesus saith unto her, thy brother shall rise
again."</p>

<p class='c013'>"Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall
rise again in the resurrection at the last day."</p>

<p class='c013'>"Jesus saith unto her, I am the resurrection
and the life, he that believeth in me, though he
were dead, yet shall ye live."</p>

<p class='c013'>"And whosoever liveth, and believeth in me,
shall never die."</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Cond.</i> Sister Electa.</p>

<p class='c012'>Electa arises and takes her position at the <i>left</i>
of her chair.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Electa.</i> Sister Conductress.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Cond.</i> I present this sister to be instructed
in the commendable virtue of
<a id='Page_LXIII'></a>heroic endurance of the wrongs of persecution,
when demanded in defense of
Truth, as illustrated in the lesson of
Electa.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Electa.</i> The second epistle of John is
addressed to "the <i>elect</i> lady and her children."
Tradition delineates her as a lady
who lived in the days of St. John the
Evangelist. Her charity, benevolence, and
generous hospitality to the poor entitled her
to great distinction.</p>

<p class='c004'>Having been reared a Pagan and afterwards
becoming a convert to the Christian
religion, she was subjected to severe trials
and the most bitter persecution. An edict
was issued by the Roman emperor that all
followers of the Christ should renounce
their faith under penalty of death. She was
visited by a band of soldiers, one of whom
handed her the cross, with a command
to trample it under foot. Electa, looking
him steadily in the face, received the
cross&mdash;precious emblem of her Saviour's
blood&mdash;pressed it with ardor to her
bosom, and cast her eyes upward as a testimony
of her love and loyalty to her
Christian faith. As Electa I represent
this historical heroine, and commend to
you the sublime virtue she exemplified
through her life, "that we love one
<a id='Page_LXIV'></a>another." You may not be called upon to
suffer in the same degree from the hand of
persecution&mdash;but there is always need of
loyalty to Truth, and, alas, there is too
often persecution.</p>

<p class='c004'>My sister, be loyal to your convictions
of truth, and murmur not at another's
loyalty. Let truth be spoken, and let it
shine through your life. If persecution
comes, bear it with heroic endurance, and
despair not of the final triumph of Truth.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sign of this degree is given by&mdash;</p>

<p class='c012'>Repeat from secret work. (15.)</p>

<p class='c011'>The pass. (16.)</p>

<p class='c004'>The color appropriate to this degree is
red: a symbol of that fervency which
should actuate all who are engaged in the
service of Truth.</p>

<p class='c004'>The cup is an emblem of charity and
hospitality, and teaches us to extend generous
aid to the victims of poverty and
distress.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sister Conductress, you will present this
sister to the Worthy Patron for further
instruction.</p>

<p class='c012'>The candidate is conducted around Electa's
chair, leaving the chair to the right, then across
<a id='Page_LXV'></a>the Star, leaving the Altar to the left, around
Esther's chair, leaving the labyrinth between
Adah and Electa, then to the right once around
the Altar, outside the Star to the Worthy Patron.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the march there should be vocal or instrumental
music, or the Worthy Patron may
recite the following:</p>

<p class='c013'><i>W. P.</i> "Grace be with you, mercy, and peace,
from God the Father."</p>

<p class='c013'>"And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I
wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that
which we had from the beginning, that we love
one another."</p>

<p class='c013'>"And this is love, that we walk after His commandments."</p>

<p class='c013'>"By this we know that we walk in the truth.
Behold what manner of love the Father hath
bestowed upon us."</p>

<p class='c013'>"That we should be called the children of God.
That our joy may be full."</p>

<p class='c013'>"Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of
God, and every one that loveth and knoweth God,
is born of God."</p>

<p class='c013'>"Herein is love, not that we loved God, but
that he first loved us. If God so loved us, we ought
also to love one another."</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Cond.</i> Worthy Patron, I present to
you this sister, who has passed through
the labyrinth of our Star, and been instructed
in those sublime virtues exemplified
by the heroines of our Order.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>W. P.</i> We hail with pleasure your
coming among us. The work of our Order
<a id='Page_LXVI'></a>is worthy of our earnest labor; and we
shall rejoice to find you excelling in zeal
our most devoted members. You will
now give attention to the address of the
Worthy Matron.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>W. M.</i> My sister, the Eastern Star is
closely related to the Masonic fraternity;
and although related to it by the dearest
ties, yet it is no part of that ancient institution.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here the wives, daughters, mothers,
widows, and sisters of Masons, may become
co-laborers with the great Brotherhood
in the service of humanity.</p>

<p class='c004'>By the laws of that ancient Order,
women are not eligible to its degrees. But
woman's heart beats responsive to the
same inspiration that prompts man to
noble deeds.</p>

<p class='c004'>She hears the cry of the orphan, the
call of want, and the piteous wail of sorrow.
She honors the Brotherhood for its
noble work, and seeks through the Eastern
Star, to be a co-worker with the Masonic
brother; to pay the tribute of her love
and labor at the same shrine, and be able
<a id='Page_LXVII'></a>to make herself known, throughout the domain
of Masonry, as being entitled to its
protection.</p>

<p class='c004'>Into this field of labor, you have now
entered. You have taken the solemn Obligation
of the Order, and been instructed
in those sublime virtues which should
adorn our lives, and make this institution
worthy of the protection and support of
all good Masons.</p>

<p class='c004'>We extend to you a fraternal love, and
shall rejoice to learn that your devotion to
the great moral and social purposes of our
Order, is earnest and persistent.</p>

<p class='c004'>That the blessing of our Heavenly
Father may rest upon our labor, let us
unite in prayer.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Chapter is called up and a circle is formed
around the Altar in the following manner by the
officers joining hands: Secretary between Adah
and Ruth&mdash;Associate Matron between Ruth and
Esther&mdash;Associate Conductress between Esther
and Martha&mdash;Treasurer between Martha and
Electa&mdash;the Worthy Matron at the left of Electa.
If desired the members may join in forming the
circle.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Worthy Patron or Chaplain will take
position at the west side of the Altar. The Conductress
<a id='Page_LXVIII'></a>with the candidate at her right, will
advance to the open space at the left of the Worthy
Matron; and when the words "golden chain thus
lengthened" in the prayer are being pronounced,
the Worthy Matron will extend her left hand and
take the right hand of candidate and the Conductress
will join the circle at her left, thus making
it complete. At the words "each link shall
fall away in death," the hands will be unclasped.
If a Chaplain officiates, the Worthy Patron will
remain in his station.</p>
<h3 class='c009'>PRAYER.</h3>
<p class='c014'>Source of all wisdom, truth, and love, Grant we
beseech Thee, that in the reception of this person
into our Order we may add strength to our
strength, and grace to our grace. O, may the
golden chain thus lengthened become the brighter
for this link, and be strengthened for the great
work we strive to do. Enlarge our powers to
benefit mankind, and to honor Thee our God.</p>

<p class='c013'>And when, one by one, each link shall fall away
in death, may the parting be temporary, and the
meeting eternal. In the world where death comes
not, may we realize the full happiness of loving
and serving Thee forever. <span class='sc'>Amen.</span></p>

<p class='c013'>Response by the Chapter.</p>

<p class='c011'>So may it ever be.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the conclusion of the prayer an Ode may be
sung while the members are standing around the
Altar. After singing the Worthy Patron seats the
Chapter. The Conductress leads the candidate to
the East, and the Worthy Matron may, at the
request of the Worthy Patron, conclude the initiation
ceremonies.</p>

<p class='c011'><a id='Page_LXIX'></a><i>W. P.</i> In taking upon yourself the
solemn Obligation of our Order, you enter
upon a new phase of life; henceforth you
will be numbered among the members of
this Order, who have for their inspiration
the Star of Bethlehem, which will guide
all the faithful to the New Jerusalem, that
city not made with hands. I must remind
you, that with privileges come responsibilities.
You have been informed that we
are in possession of certain secrets, by
means of which, we are able to make ourselves
known to each other wherever we
may meet. You have been conducted to
the several points of the Star, and been
instructed in the secret work of the Order,
which, if properly understood, will enable
you to make yourself known as a member.
That the signs and passes may be more
firmly impressed upon your mind, with the
assistance of our Conductress, I will repeat
them with explanations.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Conductress will give the signs as the
Worthy Patron explains them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first is the Daughter's sign, or the

<p class='c004'>The fourth is the Sister's sign, or the

<p class='c004'>The fifth is the Mother's sign, or the
sign of Electa. It is given by (15.) It alludes
to heroic submission, under the
wrongs of persecution.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Pass is (16.) being the impressive
lesson taught by Electa.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_LXXI'></a>Any member of the Order is at liberty
to give any one of these signs when among
strangers and desirous of becoming known
to a sister or brother. Any member seeing
one of these signs given should respond
by giving the Pass belonging to the
sign given, and asking, (17.)</p>

<p class='c004'>This is all the examination that is required
under such circumstances. It can
be followed by such questions as may be
necessary. In passing an examination to
visit a Chapter, in addition to this, you
will be required to give the signs and
passes of each degree.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is one other sign, called the salutation
sign, which is given by members on
entering or retiring from a Chapter while
in session. They shall advance in front of
the Associate Matron, and (19.)</p>

<p class='c004'>The Grip of the Order is given by (20.)</p>

<p class='c012'>The Conductress will communicate the Grip to
the candidate.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Signet is prepared to assist the
memory of those who have received the
degrees.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the outer edge of the central division
will be found the (21.)</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_LXXII'></a>I will explain the significance of the
colors, the emblematic flowers, and the
meaning of the several emblems alluding
to the distinguished characters portrayed
in the degrees.</p>

<p class='c004'>Blue symbolizes Fidelity. It is represented
by the violet.</p>

<p class='c004'>The open Bible is appropriate to Jephthah's
Daughter, as a symbol of obedience
to the word of God.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yellow symbolizes Constancy. It is represented
by the yellow jessamine.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Lily of the Valley is appropriate to
Ruth, as a symbol of loveliness among the
lowly.</p>

<p class='c004'>White symbolizes Light, Purity and
Joy. It is represented by the white lily.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Sun is appropriate to Esther, as a
symbol of the light and joy she gave to a
down-trodden race.</p>

<p class='c004'>Green symbolizes Hope and Immortality.
It is represented by the fern.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Lamb is appropriate to Martha, as
a symbol of innocence and humility.</p>

<p class='c004'>Red symbolizes Fervency. It is represented
by the red rose.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_LXXIII'></a>The Lion is appropriate to Electa, as a
symbol of the courage and power, that sustained
the martyr defenders of Truth.</p>

<p class='c004'>And, finally, my sister, Jephthah's
Daughter, because she freely sacrificed
her life to preserve her father's honor;
Ruth, poor and lowly, was faithful to the
demands of honor and justice; Esther,
noble queen, was prepared to sacrifice her
crown and life, to save her people from
destruction; Martha, from her trustful
faith and hope of immortal life; and
Electa, pre-eminent in charity, and heroic
in endurance of the wrongs of persecution;
were (18.)</p>

<p class='c004'>So may it be with you. As you illustrate
in your life the virtues of these tried
servants of God, so shall be your reward.</p>

<p class='c004'>You will now be conducted to the Secretary's
desk, where you will sign the By-Laws
of this Chapter, and become entitled
to all the privileges of membership; after
which you will be re-conducted to your
present position.</p>

<p class='c012'>While the candidate is signing the By-Laws,
there may be vocal or instrumental music. After
signing the By-Laws the candidate is conducted
<a id='Page_LXXIV'></a>to the preparation room, disrobes if robes are
used, a badge of the Order put on, and conducted
to the East, facing West. When the door
opens for the Conductress and candidate to return,
the Chapter is called up, and all join in singing
a welcome song, after which the Worthy Patron
says:</p>

<p class='c011'><i>W. P.</i> Sisters and Brothers, our sister
has passed through the several degrees of
our Order, we hope with some pleasure to
her, and we know with great satisfaction
to us. You will give her a hearty welcome
and resume order at the sound of
the gavel.</p>

  <a id='Page_LXXV'></a>
  <h2 id='chap5' class='c005'>Installation Ceremonies.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'>These ceremonies may be performed in public.
If at a special meeting, the Chapter will be declared
open with one blow of the Gavel. If regular,
it may be opened in an adjacent room and
business postponed, adjourning to the Hall for
installation, after which the Worthy Matron will
declare the Chapter closed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Installing Officer must be a Present or
Past Matron or Patron. The first board of officers
of a new Chapter must be installed by a Grand
Matron or Patron, or a Deputy; who also may
install the officers of any Chapter when requested
to do so by the Chapter.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Installing Officer, after assuming the chair,
will appoint a Marshal, who will collect the several
badges of office, and place them where they
will be convenient for use. The Secretary will
furnish the Marshal with a list of the officers to
be installed. If the installation is a public one,
an address may be delivered touching the history
and purposes of the Order.</p>

<p class='c013'>If a Grand officer presides, the Marshal will be
Grand Marshal. The officers will be addressed by
<a id='Page_LXXVI'></a>their titles and such changes made in the language
of the following ceremonies as the circumstances
require.</p>

<p class='c013'>Music, vocal or instrumental, may be introduced
as may seem best.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the appointment of the Marshal and the
collection of the badges of office, the installing
officer will proceed as follows:</p>

<p class='c011'><i>I. O.</i> Sisters and Brothers, the selection
of a new board of officers is an
important event in the history of a Chapter.
The welfare of this Chapter, and the
prosperity of our Order in this place, may
be permanently effected by the action of
those whom you have chosen to serve as
the officers of this Chapter for the ensuing
year. Before investing them with official
authority we will invoke the blessing of
Him from whom cometh all wisdom and
strength. Let us unite in prayer.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Chapter is called up, and the Installing
Officer or Chaplain offers at the altar the following</p>
<h3 class='c009'>PRAYER.</h3>
<p class='c014'>Our Father, who art in Heaven, whose wisdom
and goodness manifest themselves in all the works
of creation; with filial love and reverence we
invoke Thy blessing upon Thy children here
assembled, and grace to consecrate the labors we
<a id='Page_LXXVII'></a>have met to perform. We commend to Thy
especial care and guidance the officers elect, into
whose hands we are about to repose the government
of this Chapter. Endue them with a just
appreciation of the responsibilities they are about
to assume, and may they be ever mindful that a
Father's care is always over them, and that Thy
all-seeing eye is ever upon them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Bless and prosper our beloved Order; may it be
known and honored among the institutions of the
land as one whose foundation is laid upon the
enduring principle of Truth. Direct our footsteps
in ways of pleasantness and paths of peace,
and may all our doings reflect honor upon Thy
Holy Name. <span class='sc'>Amen.</span></p>

by the W. P., A. M., etc. If the Warder and Sentinel

or appointed, may occupy their stations until
their successors are installed. When all are in
their places, the Marshal will say:</p>

is willing to assume it, in the hope that by

will be admitted who would injuriously
effect the peace and harmony of the
Chapter.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Ans.</i> I do.</p>

<p class='c004'>You agree to do all in your power to
promote the welfare of this Chapter, and
to enforce, to the best of your ability, all
the rules and regulations of the Order.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Ans.</i> I do.</p>

<p class='c004'>Members of &mdash;&mdash; Chapter, you have
heard your Worthy Matron elect in the
pledges she has made; do you promise to
support her in the performance of her
duties?</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Ans.</i> We do.</p>

<p class='c004'>My sister, the office of Worthy Matron
is one of great responsibility, and it will
require your utmost attention, wisdom and
forbearance. The members will look to
you, not only for counsel in all matters
that come before the Chapter, but for
advice and sympathy in their troubles and
sorrows. It should be your constant
study, therefore, how best to cultivate the
social virtues, and avoid unpleasant misunderstandings
<a id='Page_LXXXII'></a>among the members of
your Chapter. You should be cautious in
the execution of your trust, courteous to
the members, and ever ready to render a
helping hand to sisters or brothers in
affliction or adversity. You should set an
example of good order and punctuality,
for only by so doing can you expect similar
attention from others. Whatever you
would deem praiseworthy in another in
your position, you should carefully imitate,
and with equal care avoid what would be
blameworthy. Within the Chapter it will
be your duty to see that its regular meetings
are held, and special meetings called,
whenever the good of the Chapter
demands them; that your subordinates
fill their stations with honor and usefulness;
that the By-Laws be implicitly
obeyed; that the funds, records, rituals,
and other property of the Chapter be
properly preserved by the officers in
whose charge they are placed; that the
cry of the widow and orphan shall never
be heard in vain; and that this Chapter
fails in nothing for which it was established.
<a id='Page_LXXXIII'></a>All this you should strive to
accomplish by the zealous exercise of your
prerogatives as Worthy Matron, to which
exalted position your associates have been
pleased to elect you.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sister Marshal, you will invest our sister
with the badge of her office.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Marshal will invest the officers with their
badges as she is requested to do so by the Installing

you that upon your
judgment and discretion
rests the government of
this Chapter, and, in a great
measure, the prosperity of
our beautiful Order.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is your duty to preside during the

avoid exceeding the powers with which
you have intrusted them.</p>

enter upon the proceedings of a new year.
But we know not what is before us. No
one can affirm that another year, or even
a single day, will be committed to our
trust. Therefore, if we have been faithful
heretofore, let us increase our exertions
for the future.</p>

<p class='c004'>As among the objects for which we are
associated together is our purpose to protect
the widow and orphan, comfort the
afflicted, sympathize with the sorrowing,
and relieve the destitute and distressed,
I trust that no discord will ever rise
among us to imperil the success of our
efforts to accomplish these charitable
purposes, and increase the happiness of
ourselves and others.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_C'></a>Let us be kind, forbearing and forgiving,
one towards another. Let us return
kindness for hostility. Let us sacredly
preserve our lips from slander and evil
speaking; and whatever may be our failings,
let us throw around each other the
broad mantle of charity. And, finally, let
us be governed in words and deeds by the
golden rule, "Whatsoever ye would that
men should do to you, do ye even so to
them: for this is the law and the
prophets."</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus may we confidently hope that in
the good providence of God, each of us
will be brought, through a useful and
happy life, to a blissful close, and triumphant
entrance upon the joys of celestial
life.</p>

You will also receive the Constitution

thoroughly acquainted with, and see
promptly obeyed. I now present to you
the Gavel, an emblem of your authority;

hope that you will never use it in
an arbitrary or dictatorial manner, remembering
that we should charitably temper
justice with mercy. You will now assume

<p class='c011'><i>Grand &mdash;&mdash;.</i> Sisters and brothers of
the Grand Chapter, these persons, selected
by you, are now ready and willing to take
upon themselves the obligations, duties
and responsibilities of office. In our
beautiful Order, preferment to office
should not be sought after, but should
come to the individual chosen, as an
honor justly merited and freely bestowed.
Those only should be chosen, who, by
<a id='Page_CV'></a>their reputation, their work, and high
moral character, command the esteem and
confidence of our members, and can give
us standing and credit before the world.
Do you believe they possess these qualifications,
and now desire that they shall be
installed into the offices to which they
have been chosen?</p>

<p class='c012'>The Grand Chapter responds:</p>

<p class='c011'>We do.</p>

<p class='c012'>Installing Officer continues:</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Grand &mdash;&mdash;.</i> Sisters and brothers-elect,
there being no objection against
either of you, gives us full assurance of
your competency to discharge the responsible
duties to be assigned you. You
have been chosen to take charge of the
affairs of this Grand Chapter for the ensuing
year.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is no small mark of esteem to be
thus selected; let it be your aim to make
the ensuing year the most prosperous in
the history of this Grand Chapter; then
you will find in the record of its prosperity
the reward of your faithful service.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_CVI'></a>You will please give your assent to the
obligation of office.</p>

<p class='c004'>Do you each sacredly promise to support,
maintain and enforce the Constitution,
By-Laws, and Regulations of this
Grand Chapter, be obedient to its orders
and directions, and, to the best of your
knowledge and ability, impartially and
faithfully discharge the duties of your
office, and use your utmost endeavors to
make yourself useful, and your station
honorable, in the office with which I am
now about to invest you?</p>

<p class='c012'>They severally assent, and the Installing Officer
will then seat the Grand Chapter, the officers
elect being seated together, and the ceremonies
will proceed, as follows:</p>

<p class='c011'><i>G. M.</i> Grand &mdash;&mdash;, I have the honor
to present, for installation, Sister &mdash;&mdash;,
duly elected Grand Matron for the ensuing
year. Our sister is fully aware of the
great responsibility she is assuming, in
the acceptance of this important position,
yet she is willing to undertake it, in the
belief that, with the aid and assistance of
the sisters and brothers, and by the help
<a id='Page_CVII'></a>of God, she will not fail in the performance
of her duty, and thus prove that the
confidence reposed in her has not been
misapplied.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Grand &mdash;&mdash;.</i> Sister &mdash;&mdash;, you have
been elected by the free ballot of the
members of this Grand Chapter, to occupy
the most exalted position in their power
to bestow upon a sister; a just and deserving
tribute to your zeal and worth, and I
congratulate you upon your preferment.</p>

<p class='c004'>The high honors attached to the office
of Grand Matron are accompanied by
weighty and delicate responsibilities. It
is expected that you will have a watchful
care over the interests of this Grand Chapter,
see that its Constitutions, By-Laws
and Regulations, orders and edicts are
promptly enforced throughout this jurisdiction,
that subordinate officers discharge
their duties, and that, by your own respect
for law and good government, you will
cause all others to find the strongest
incentive of obedience to all lawful commands.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_CVIII'></a>Your duties are more specifically set forth
in the Constitution, to which I refer you,
with the admonition: Be cautious in
your words, courteous in your actions,
sincere in your rulings, governing with
moderation and decorum, trusting that
your well-known zeal in the cause of the
Order will lead you to discharge these
important trusts with lasting benefit to
this Grand Chapter and great credit to
yourself.</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>You will now be invested
with the proper badge

<p class='c012'>After she is in her station, the Installing officer
will call up the Grand Chapter, and say:</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Grand &mdash;&mdash;.</i> Grand Matron, behold
your sisters and brothers! Sisters and
brothers, behold your Grand Matron, and
salute her with the Grand Honors.</p>

<p class='c012'>Seats the Grand Chapter.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>G. M.</i> Grand &mdash;&mdash;, it is with pleasure
I introduce to you Brother &mdash;&mdash;,

you will find him as willing to discharge
the duties as to enjoy the high honors
conferred upon him.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Grand &mdash;&mdash;.</i> Brother &mdash;&mdash;, you
have been elected by the free choice of
the members of this Grand Chapter to
occupy the most exalted position in their
power to bestow upon a brother; a just
compliment to your zeal and worth, and
for which I offer you my sincere congratulations.
Your intimate acquaintance
with the rules and affairs of our Order
justify me in saying that the members
have exercised a sound discretion in this
selection. You are elevated to a position
from which the power and prerogative
may depart with the expiration of your
term of service, but the honor and dignity,
except by your own act, <i>never</i>!</p>

<p class='c004'>Your duties are to issue dispensations,
organize and supervise new Chapters, and
assist the Grand Matron in the discharge
of her duties. Other duties appropriate
to your high office might be named, which
will readily suggest themselves to a sensitive
<a id='Page_CX'></a>mind, imbued with a proper zeal to
promote the interests of our Order. The
field is broad, and whitening for the harvest;
may you be the instrument of gathering
many sheaves to our garner, that it
may be said of you, "Well done, thou
good and faithful servant; thou hast been
faithful over a few things, I will make
thee ruler over many things."</p>

office to which you have been elected is by
far the most important, if not the most
<a id='Page_CXIII'></a>honorable, within the gift of this Grand
Chapter. Yours is an onerous and most
responsible charge. But few are competent
to perform it in the thorough manner
it demands. Failure or neglect upon
your part will complicate and embarrass
all our proceedings, and give us a disgraceful
record before the world. To
you, also, is intrusted the collection of all
funds due the Grand Chapter, the custody
of the seal, records, books, and papers.
You are the correspondent and financial
agent of the Grand Chapter, the medium
of intercourse between the officers and
members thereof, as well as between them
and Subordinate Chapters. The faithful
discharge of all your various duties
requires constant and systematic work,
a careful keeping of records and accounts,

financial interests of the Order, receiving
the funds, through the Grand Secretary,
from the different sources of revenue,
keep them safely invested, render a just
account thereof, and pay the same out
only on proper vouchers, with the consent

<p class='c014'><a id='Page_CXXV'></a>At the burial of a sister, the badges of the
members and officers should be draped with crape.
A floral five-pointed Star should be provided,
having flowers of the appropriate colors for the
several points. The Star officers should each
have a small bouquet, or a few loose flowers of the
appropriate color. A few flowers should also be
provided for the Worthy Matron and Worthy
Patron.</p>

<p class='c013'>The floral Star may be deposited with the
casket, or be retained by the family of the
deceased.</p>

<p class='c013'>This service, although primarily designed for
use at the Grave, can, if it is thought best to do
so, be performed within the Chapter room, the
Church, or other appropriate place. The members
may meet at the Chapter room, or at the

<p class='c012'>When all is ready, the services should commence
with a short strain of solemn music, "The
<a id='Page_CXXVII'></a>Lord is my Shepherd," etc. After which the
Worthy Patron will say:</p>

<p class='c011'><i>W. P.</i> Sisters and Brothers, we have
gathered at this solemn hour to perform
those final rites which affection has prescribed
for our departed sister. She, who
was with us but yesterday, has been summoned
hence by a messenger who cometh
sooner or later for us all.</p>

<p class='c004'>How appropriately may we gather
around her remains, and together pay
love's tribute to her memory.</p>

<p class='c004'>She has indeed passed beyond the reach
of praise, or the touch of censure. It is
not, therefore, to her that we tender this
our heart's saddest offering.</p>

<p class='c004'>We are here in acknowledgment of
sacred ties now severed, of memories tenderly
cherished, and hearts touched with
sympathy for loved ones bereaved.</p>

<p class='c004'>Our sister has finished her allotted task
in the conflict of life. The chapter of her
earthly sojourn is closed, but her many
virtues shall not go unrecorded.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_CXXVIII'></a>For a time we have walked with her in
the pilgrimage of life, and around the
same altar we have learned the lessons of
our Order.</p>

<p class='c004'>As she was faithful to her convictions
of right, as she was obedient to the
demands of honor and justice in her station;
as she loved kindred and friends,
and in affliction evinced a trustful faith;
and as she lived in the spirit of charity
and the love of truth, so shall be her
reward.</p>

<p class='c004'>Remembering her many virtues, we are
indeed mourners at her grave, and in the
house of sorrow we would drop the tear of
affectionate sympathy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sisters, brothers, and friends, as we
stand in this solemn presence we may
hear the voice of this Providence speaking
to us.</p>

<p class='c004'>Not long shall we wait ere we obey the
inexorable decree of Death, and follow
our sister.</p>

<p class='c004'>How brief and full of mystery is human
life! Who can fathom its purpose, or disclose
<a id='Page_CXXIX'></a>its issues. We entered life as it
were but yesterday; to-day we perform
our allotted task, and to-morrow we go&mdash;who
knows whither? We strain our eyes
in vain endeavor to scan with mortal
vision the infinite shore. But, thanks to
our Heavenly Father, who gives fruition
to His children's hopes, He bids us look
yet again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Standing beside the Broken Column,
we may, with Martha's trustful faith, look
beyond the shore of time, and know that
our sister, though lost to mortal vision, is
only waiting beyond the river to welcome
us to our eternal home.</p>

<p class='c004'>"In my Father's house are many mansions;
if it were not so, I would have told
you, I go to prepare a place for you, that
where I am there ye may be also." O, let
the comforting assurance come to us,
"That if our earthly house of this tabernacle
were dissolved, we have a building
of God, a house not made with hands,
eternal in the Heavens."</p>

<p class='c004'>Instructed by this Providence, may we
go from this place of mourning, and this
<a id='Page_CXXX'></a>hour of reflection, with the inspiration of
a new hope, and earnest purpose.</p>

<p class='c011'><a id='Page_CXXXI'></a><i>W. P.</i> The examples and symbols of
our Order are full of useful and impressive
lessons. They speak to us in this
solemn hour with unwonted significance.</p>

<p class='c004'>These floral tributes, the offering of sisterly
affection, echo voices often heard
from the several points of our Star; they
symbolize, in the ritual of our Order, virtues
which should adorn our lives. How
appropriately, then, may they bear an
important part in this solemn ceremonial.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sisters of our Star, you who represent
the five distinguished heroines of our
Order, have you anything to offer ere we
leave the grave of our departed sister?</p>

<p class='c004'>Sister Adah, what is the voice and
tribute from the Blue point of our
emblematic Star?</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Adah.</i> Blue symbolizes fidelity, and
is appropriate to Jephthah's Daughter,
who, in the morning of life, surrendered
to the grave the brightest of earthly
hopes, that she might be faithful to her
convictions of right, and preserve her
<a id='Page_CXXXII'></a>father's honor. As a token of faithfulness
to the memory of our sister, I deposit in
her grave this tribute of faithful love.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the proper time each officer will drop into
the grave, or place upon the casket, the flowers
provided for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c013'>Adah deposits her tribute, and then, addressing
Ruth, says:</p>

<p class='c011'>Sister Ruth, what is the voice and
tribute from the Yellow point of our Star?</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Ruth.</i> Yellow symbolizes constancy,
teaching faithful obedience to the
demands of honor and justice. Ruth
exemplified these virtues in humble station,
and sought the society of the good
and true. In token of appreciation of
these virtues, I deposit in the grave of our
sister this floral tribute.</p>

<p class='c012'>Deposits her tribute, and then, addressing
Esther, says:</p>

<p class='c011'>Sister Esther, what is the voice and
tribute from the White point of our Star?</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Esther.</i> White symbolizes light and
purity. The heroic Queen Esther evinced
<a id='Page_CXXXIII'></a>the purity of her motive and love of kindred
and friends, by her willingness to
risk the loss of crown and life, to save
her people from death. In token of sincere
affection for our sister, I deposit in
her grave this emblem of light and purity.</p>

<p class='c012'>Deposits her tribute, and then, addressing
Martha, says:</p>

<p class='c011'>Sister Martha, what is the voice and
tribute from the Green point of our Star?</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Martha.</i> Green is an emblem of
Nature's life and beauty. The evergreen is
a symbol of immortal life, and teaches us,
that in the economy of God there is no
death; forms change, but the spirit survives.
Martha, beside the grave of her
beloved brother, avowed her trustful faith
and hope of immortal life. In the full
assurance of our sister's entrance upon a
glorious immortality, I deposit in her
grave this evergreen.</p>

<p class='c012'>Deposits her tribute, and then, addressing
Electa, says:</p>

<p class='c011'>Sister Electa, what is the voice and
tribute from the Red point of our Star?</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_CXXXIV'></a><i>Electa.</i> Red symbolizes fervency and
zeal. Electa represents those who have
been pre-eminent in charity, and heroic in
endurance of the wrongs of persecution.
In token of the fervency of our affection
for our sister, I deposit in her grave this
tribute of love.</p>

<p class='c012'>Deposits her tribute, and then, addressing
the Worthy Matron, says:</p>

<p class='c011'>Worthy Matron, we have spoken from
the five points of our emblematic Star, but
our departed sister hears us not. Is it in
vain that we speak to the living?</p>

<p class='c004'><i>W. M.</i> You have spoken well, my
sisters. It is not in vain that we hear the
oft repeated lessons of our Star. It is
true that our sister hears not with mortal
ear the lessons she was wont to learn from
you; but is it true that she listens not to
our words of love, and sees not the beautiful
tributes strewn within her grave?
May not her quickened spirit, freed from
its earthly tenement, yet hover around the
loved ones here assembled, listen to our
words, and perceive with clearer vision
our every movement?</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_CXXXV'></a>She needs not to be ministered unto;
but may she not now minister to us?
"Are they not all ministering spirits?"
saith the apostle.</p>

<p class='c004'>Love is an attribute of the soul, and
imperishable. Our sister's affection ceases
not; therefore may she not now be whispering
to grief-stricken hearts, "Peace
be still," "Lo, I am with you always."
Think not that the spirit world is distant.
Our loved ones, though lost to mortal
sight, may yet be with us in spiritual
existence. Let their loving presence be
to us a perpetual inspiration, calling us to
a higher moral and spiritual life.</p>

<p class='c004'>These beautiful flowers are the highest
expression of Nature's loveliness. We
never tire of looking at their perfect and
delicately variegated tints. From time
immemorial they have been endowed with
expressive language. They speak to us,
"To whisper hope whene'er our faith
grows dim." But these floral emblems,
with all their exquisite loveliness, are but
dim reflections of the glories that may be
<a id='Page_CXXXVI'></a>unfolded to our spiritual vision. In token
of our hope that such an unfolding of
spiritual life may come to us all, I scatter
these flowers within the grave of our
departed sister. May we cherish her
memory and emulate her virtues.</p>

<p class='c012'>Deposits her tribute, and then, addressing the
Worthy Patron, says:</p>

<p class='c011'>Worthy Patron, within the grave, hallowed
by the tenderest ties of human
affection, we scatter these floral emblems
of Nature's loveliness, and spiritual life.
May we not trust all else to the Father's
loving care?</p>

<p class='c004'><i>W. P.</i> The Infinite Father's ever
watchful care is nowhere more impressively
taught, than by His voice speaking
to us through the floral kingdom. Over
the whole earth where life exists, flowers
bloom in endless variety and profusion,
there is no place so obscure but that they
blossom there and give to the world their
beauty and fragrance. Some open with
<a id='Page_CXXXVII'></a>the rising sun, and close with his setting
rays. Others open to the full moon and
starry firmament, and shrink before the
piercing gaze of the king of day.</p>

<p class='c004'>So the Father's love goes forth by day
and night, to the weakest, most humble,
and obscure of His children.</p>

<p class='c004'>We are told to consider the lilies of the
field, and learn the paternal love of Him,
beyond whose watchful care none can
stray. Not a sparrow falls without His
notice. "Ye are of more value than many
sparrows."</p>

<p class='c004'>In token of our trust in the all-embracing
love of the Infinite Father, I deposit
these emblems of His watchful care in the
grave of our departed sister.</p>

<p class='c012'>Drops the flowers, and continues as follows:</p>

<p class='c011'>Sisters and brothers, within the city of
the dead, we consign to the bosom of
mother earth all that was mortal of our
departed sister. The body we leave in the
grave is but the casket which held the
<a id='Page_CXXXVIII'></a>precious jewel of life. We bear it tenderly
to its resting-place, because it is the
form by which we knew her in our Chapter.
Peacefully let it rest in the hallowed
ground where we place it. Upon her
grave flowerets will bloom amid all the
countless activities of Nature's life.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"The murmuring brook, the bird on airy wing,</div>
      <div class='line'>And whispering pines, will here her requiem sing."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Over her the fleeting shadows will pass.
The rising sun will scatter over the chambers
of the dead his gladsome rays, and tint
the western sky with the glories of departing
day. In the hush of night the feeble
rays of countless stars, traveling centuries
on their journey here, will finally rest
upon her grave.</p>

<p class='c004'>We leave in this lowly bed the earthly
form of our departed sister, and may the
hallowing influence of this providence go
with us in the remaining journey of our
life, and when our earthly mission is over,
and we are "beyond the smiling and the
<a id='Page_CXXXIX'></a>weeping" of earth, may we gather with
the loved ones gone before.</p>

<p class='c004'>Let us unite in prayer.</p>
<h3 class='c009'>PRAYER.</h3>
<p class='c014'>Our Father who art in Heaven, in whom we
live, and in whom are all the issues of life and
death. We come to Thee, in this hour of sorrow,
and ask that we may so learn the lessons of this
hour, that when it shall be our turn to lay aside
our mortality, that we may do it with trustful
faith in Thee and hope of a glorious immortality.
We pray Thee to look with tender compassion upon
these Thy children, whose household has been
broken by this providence. May they lie passive
in the arms of Thy chastening love, and realize
that there is wisdom and goodness in all Thy
appointments. Sanctify this bereavement to the
good of us all. May it be the means of drawing
us closer to Thee, and of our loving and serving
Thee forever. And as it has pleased Thee to call
from the toils of earth the soul of our beloved
sister, we commit her remains to the silent tomb.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, hopefully
looking to a joyful reunion with her, in that
land where separation and death are known no
more, forever. <span class='sc'>Amen.</span></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
